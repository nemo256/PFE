abstract = {Leukocytes count in the blood smear images plays an important role in identifying the overall health of the patient. The major steps involved in leukocytes counting system are segmentation and counting. However, the counting accuracy is greatly affected due to the morphological diversity of cells, the presence of staining artifacts and the overlapped cells. Therefore, this paper introduces a new framework to segment and counting of leukocytes. To segment leukocytes, an edge strength-based Grabcut method has been proposed. Later, the leukocyte region including the overlapped cells was counted using the novel gradient circular hough transform (GCHT) method. The research work was performed on ALL-IDB and Cellavision datasets. The proposed segmentation method has yielded high precision, recall and f-measure compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, comparison analysis was performed between the region count obtained using the existing and the GCHT method. The overall experimental results of the work showed that the proposed framework produced more accuracy in counting the leukocytes.}

abstract = {Yeast fluorescence microscopic images are widely used to observe the living conditions and survival of yeast cells under experimental conditions. Accurate cell counting provides key quantitative feedback and plays key roles in biological research as well as in industrial and biomedical applications. Unfortunately, the commonly used manual counting method is time-intensive, poorly standardized, and non-reproducible. Here, we developed a two-stage framework using parallel modified U-Nets together with seed guided water-mesh algorithm for automatic segmentation and yeast cells counting. The proposed framework was tested with independent images, of which the ground truth of yeast cell number and locations was done by skilled technicians. Our method improved cell counting by reducing bias and demonstrated a 99.35\% consistent recall rate of experienced manual counting, and decreased the time required from 5 minutes on average to only 5 seconds for each image.},
